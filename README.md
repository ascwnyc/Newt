# Newt

Newt is a multi-purpose Discord bot designed in Python.

## Foreword

The main design principles for Newt trend towards general functionality, simplicity in interfacing with users, and a narrowed focus of its detailed feature set.

It is planned sometime in the future to convert the project's language to JavaScript, and then TypeScript. This change is mainly comes from the longevity the program will have in a web-based language like JavaScript, and it's compatability with a web-based API like Discord.

***Note:** Newt is very much still a work-in-progress. Any and all functionality is subject ot change.*
