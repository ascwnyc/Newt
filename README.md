# Newt

Newt is a multi-purpose Discord bot designed for niche servers.

## Foreword

Newt was originally designed as a personal project between university assignments. Since then, a lot has changed from the inital scope of the project, as well as my own proficiency in coding in Python, which is also the language Newt is coded in.

The main design principles for Newt are now trending towards general functionality, simplicity in interfacing with users, and narrowing the focus on its detailed feature set.

***Note:** Newt is very much still a work-in-progress. Any and all functionality is subject ot change.*
